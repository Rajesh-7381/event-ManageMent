2. Event Creation:
- Develop features for users to create new events, specifying details such as event title,
description, date, time, location, and ticketing information.
- Allow event organizers to customize event settings, such as privacy settings and ticket pricing.
3. Event Management Dashboard:
- Design a dashboard interface for event organizers to manage their events, including viewing
attendee lists, tracking ticket sales, and updating event details.
- Provide options for organizers to communicate with attendees and send event-related
notifications.
4. Event Discovery:
- Implement a search and browsing functionality to allow users to discover upcoming events
based on criteria such as location, date, category, or keyword.
- Include filters and sorting options to help users find relevant events more easily.
5. Ticketing and Registration:
- Integrate a ticketing system to facilitate event registration and ticket purchases.
- Enable users to register for events, select ticket types, and make payments securely through
the platform.
6. Attendee Engagement Features:
- Include interactive features to engage event attendees before, during, and after the event,
such as discussion forums, polls, and live Q&A sessions.
- Provide event organizers with tools to interact with attendees, gather feedback, and foster
community engagement.
